## Hello there!

I am @pabloapa and I like to code. I started coding back in 2002 with ASP3 and JS and I found myself absorbed in it as a mean to solve problems.

First it was a small web page to manage students 👨‍🎓 in an university course.

Then they were multiple small apps for banking 💸, from real-time updates to batch processing flows.

After a few years, I moved to travel and tourism, as part of an ambicious project for building a GDS (Global Distribution System) for low-cost airlines.

In my last 10 years of freelancing, I've been working in several projects for the travel ✈ and healthcare 👨‍⚕️ industry, as well as having my own pet-project (the one for university courses), which ended up growing until having more than 1000 courses and 100000 users.

My toolkit 🛠 includes .NET C#, HTML, JS and CSS, and while I still can't get used to some of the overshooting in software architecture (specially for small projects) I enjoy learning new tricks and ways to do things.

You can reach me at pabloapa at gmail.
